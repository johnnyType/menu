# A WAY TO GET PIZZA BASED ON A BINARY NUMBER

##### We can observe that each topping combination can be determined by a 12 digits binary number.

##### Assume that our topping list is ordered as: (This order can give some benefits for us to offer a vegan pizza)
```
["ham","bacon","pepperoni","garlic","mushroom","pineapple","green peppers","arugula","basil","onion","olives","artichoke"]
|------ non vegan -------| --------------------------------------- vegan ------------------------------------------------|
```
  
##### For example, topping combination ```["mushroom","pepperoni","green peppers","arugula"]``` can be represented as 001010110000, which is equal to decimal number 688. 

# PROPERTIES BASED ON THE BINARY NUMBER REPRESENTATION OF PIZZA

##### We can also observe that all vegan pizzas can be represented as binary number from 0 to 000111111111, which is decimal number range from 0 to 511. That means there is 512 different kinds of vegan pizzas. (This is due to the benefit of specific order of topping list)

##### We can use the similar method to get the non-vegan pizzas number which is from 001000000000 to 111111111111, which is decimal number range from 512 to 4095. That means there is 3583 different kinds of non-vegan pizzas.

# FINAL ALGORITHM PROPOSAL

##### Based on the obeservation we can generate a menu on a date by:
- #####     map each date (day/month/year) to a range unique decimal number, which is calculated by day+(month-1)*31 (By this way, we can make the same date of different year will map to the same number and any generated number is unique among each year). We denote the number value as V. This V ranges from 1 to 372.
- #####     Then we directly select the vegan pizza based on V.
- #####     For the non-vegan pizza, the 9 non vegan pizza we select are the number values from 512+(V-1)*9 to 520+(v-1)*9
- #####     For each number we convert it into 12 digits binary number and then get topping combination based on the toppling list.

# HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
### WE CAN RUN THE FOLLOWING LINE IN CRONTAB JOB TO AUTOMATICALLY GENREATE EVERYDAY'S MENU
```bash
./generate_todays_menu.sh 
```
The result will be printed on terminal. For example, here is the result for 3/6/2021
```python
[['green peppers', 'pepperoni'], ['bacon', 'garlic', 'green peppers', 'ham', 'mushroom', 'olives'], ['garlic', 'green peppers', 'mushroom', 'olives', 'pepperoni'], ['garlic', 'green peppers', 'ham', 'mushroom', 'olives', 'pepperoni'], ['bacon', 'garlic', 'green peppers', 'mushroom', 'olives', 'pepperoni'], ['bacon', 'garlic', 'green peppers', 'ham', 'mushroom', 'olives', 'pepperoni'], ['green peppers', 'olives', 'pineapple'], ['green peppers', 'ham', 'olives', 'pineapple'], ['bacon', 'green peppers', 'olives', 'pineapple'], ['bacon', 'green peppers', 'ham', 'olives', 'pineapple']]
```
### WE CAN ONLY CALL THE PYTHON FUNCTION MANUALLY AND PASS DATE WITH FORMAT YYYYMMDD
```bash
python generate_menu.py 20210306
```
The result would be the same as previous.

# NOTE: The solution only has two parts: 1. solution program and utils, which contains some generic reusable function. 2. Test file, which can test whether the program can satisfy all 5 constraints or not. 
# There would be a log file for monitoring, but I don't have that much time, just build a folder there.
